# Git Assignment- Practical 4

One C file that gives an array of tan(x) for 13 evenly spaced points between x=0 degrees and x=60 degrees and then gives a trapezoidal rule estimate of the area under tan curve using 13 evenly spaced points between x=0 degrees and x=60 degrees (i.e., the same points).

## Compile
* gcc -o tanArrayAndTrapezoid tanArrayAndTrapezoid.c -lm

## Execute
* ./tanArrayAndTrapezoid
