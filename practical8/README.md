# Practical 8

Code for practical 8 of the ICHEC introduction to programming concepts course. This folder contains two .c files. One is for an iterative approach to finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers. The other is for a recursive approach to the same problem.

## Compile

gcc -o iter iterative.c

gcc -o rec recursive.c

## Execute

./iter

./rec
