# Practical 9

Codes for practical 9, including a header file with a function to determine whether a square matrix is magic or not, and two text files containing matrices. I have realised that I completed this task before all the relevant files were uploaded on Brightspace so my code is slightly different. However the code should perform the same functionality.

## Compile

gcc -o main main9.c -lm

The math library needs to be linked.

## Execute

./main
